# Fruit Tree Species Classification using CNN and Textural Features 

This repository archives scripts and sample data that use CNN model and spectral and textural information from publicly available remote sensing datasets of Sentinel-2 and Planet to classify fruit tree species.

## Instruction ##
Before running the scripts, you need to:
1. Instal Python at least version 3.10.
2. Create virtual environment.
3. Install the required package in the `requirements.txt` using `pip`.

## Guide to the Scripts ##
This modelling consists:
`cnnTropiTrees.ipynb`

	This Jupyter Notebook includes codes to load the trained CNN model and sample data to classify the normalized data of spectral and textural bands into different fruit tree species: Pomelo, Coconut, Coconut Intercropping, Rambutan, and Durian.
